It prints out maximum, minimum, mean and median of the datased. The results are rounded down to the neares integer value.

In the assignment are declared and defined several functions:
print_statistics() - A function that prints the statistics of an array including minimum, maximum, mean, and median.
print_array() -  Given an array of data and a length, prints the array to the screen
find_median() - Given an array of data and a length, returns the median value
find_mean() -  Given an array of data and a length, returns the mean
find_maximum() -  Given an array of data and a length, returns the maximum
find_minimum() -  Given an array of data and a length, returns the minimum
sort_array() - Given an array of data and a length, sorts the array from largest to smallest.  (The zeroth element should be the largest value, and the last element (n-1) should be the smallest value.)
